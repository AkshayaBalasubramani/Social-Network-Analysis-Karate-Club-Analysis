# Karate Kid - Social Network Analysis
## Social network analysis  
Social network analysis (SNA) investigates the connections and relationships between people or groups within a social network. Understanding these networks' structure and features and locating significant actors, influential figures, and interaction patterns are the main objectives of SNA. SNA often entails gathering information on the connections between people, visualizing these connections as a network graph, and then analyzing the resulting graph using mathematical and statistical methods. To better understand the dynamics of social systems and to guide decision-making, the insights gleaned by SNA can be applied to several applications, including behavior, public health, organizational behavior, and political science.

## The Data
Zachary collected information about the original club and the dataset obtained is now known as “Zachary’s karate
club” network. The groups that emerged from the fission of
the karate club were factions not necessarily recognised by
the club members. Instead, the friendship network among
members gave rise to them during a moment of conflict.
The dataset called karate.gml can be obtained at

we will use it in the rest of this section. It contains 34 nodes
representing individuals within the karate club. The edges
in the network are given by interactions between two
individuals outside the activities of the club such as actual
lessons or meetings.   

## Process
The project makes use of NetwokX library for analysis and concluding about the clusters,centrality measures and insights of the social network.  
The analysis gives the result of the split of the Karate club due to a few issues.John A ans Hi are the two prominant nodes whose behaviour and analysis must me studied.

## Centrality Analysis
1.degree centrality   
For finding very connected individuals, popular individuals, individuals who are likely to hold most information or individuals who can quickly connect with the wider network.  
2.betweeness centrality    
For finding the individuals who influence the flow around a system.   
3.closeness centrality    
For finding the individuals who are best placed to influence the entire network most quickly.   
4.eigen value centrality   
EigenCentrality is a good ‘all-round’ SNA score, handy for understanding human social networks, but also for understanding networks like malware propagation.    
5.PageRank centrality   
Because it takes into account direction and connection weight, PageRank can be helpful for understanding citations and authority.
